# Polyglot AI

## Problem
Supplement text with other channels - AI can use voice and images both ways.

## Pattern
Use the right modality for the task.

Voice changes quality of life - speak naturally, get responses while hands are busy.
Modern voice recognition is so good it's like effortless typing. Additionally, you're speaking into AI which is very good at interpreting typos and misspellings - so it makes you more powerful.

Images work both ways - AI reads screenshots, diagrams, designs.
Show AI a mockup, get implementation. Show a bug screenshot, get diagnosis.

Pick the channel that feels most natural for what you're doing.

## Example
Debugging UI: Screenshot → AI spots the alignment issue
Design implementation: Figma export → AI writes the CSS
Hands busy cooking: Voice → AI reads you the next steps
Quick code review: Share screen → AI sees what you see
