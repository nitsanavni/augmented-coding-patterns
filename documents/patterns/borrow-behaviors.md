# Borrow Behaviors

## Problem
The solution already exists, but it's not in the form we need it, or not where we need it.

## Pattern
AI can quickly grab and transform from other sources:
- Styles from designs (colors, spacing, icons)
- Patterns from other implementations
- Code concepts across languages

Give AI an example and it adapts it to your context.
Show a JavaScript nullable pattern, get the Python version.
Point to a Figma design, get matching CSS.
Reference another implementation, get your version.

## Example
**Design to Code**: Designer created Figma mockup to improve design of existing app → Use AI to apply it to your app 

**Cross-language**: Show JavaScript nullables → AI creates Python equivalent with proper idioms

**Parallel Borrowing**: Created 10 implementations → Pick best parts from each → AI combines them. Really powerful
