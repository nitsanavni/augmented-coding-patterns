# Ground Rules

## Child of
[[knowledge-document.md]]

## Problem
Need essential information in every session without re-explaining or remembering to include it

## Pattern
Auto-loaded knowledge documents
- Always in context
- Hierarchical: global (user-level) → project → folder
- Contains: behaviors, tools, context, links - whatever is essential for that scope

## Example
`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` - partnership style, code preferences, available tools
`project/CLAUDE.md` - project type (POC vs production), team standards, links to key docs
