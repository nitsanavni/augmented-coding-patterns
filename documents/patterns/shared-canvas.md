# Shared Canvas

## Problem
Domain experts and developers speak different languages.

## Pattern
Text and markdown files can work as shared canvas. All humans and AI can collaborate in it.

Use markdown files as:
- Specs both can refine
- Documentation both can update
- Plans both can modify
- Knowledge both can expand

Version control tracks changes. Both partners contribute. Voice inputs empower contribution further.

## Example
Grab your knowledge expert and talk through feature together with AI.
Have AI sketch down the solution. Expert can contribute on the same ground as developer, there's no wall of code in between anymore.
