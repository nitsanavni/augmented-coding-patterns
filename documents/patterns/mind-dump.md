# Mind Dump

## Pattern
Speak unfiltered thoughts directly into AI. Don't organize, don't structure - just dump everything.

Modern dictation (Whisper, Wispr Flow) + AI's natural language understanding = you can think out loud and AI extracts signal from noise.

Speed of voice input enables qualitative shift:
- From crafted prompts → stream of consciousness
- From organized thoughts → raw brain dump
- From typing bottleneck → speaking at thought speed

AI handles the mess. You handle the thinking.

**After the dump:** "Ask me questions" - turn monologue into dialogue. AI surfaces gaps and clarifies understanding.

## Example

**Context loading while walking:**
Ramble entire project context into microphone. AI picks up requirements, constraints, history, concerns - everything you mention while pacing.

**Debugging out loud:**
"So this function is supposed to... wait but it's actually doing... and I think the issue is around... oh and also we changed that thing last week..."
AI extracts the relevant details and problem structure.

**Too tired to type:**
End of day, mentally exhausted. Can still talk through ideas. Voice carries you when fingers won't.

**Requirements gathering:**
Stakeholder talks, you record. AI extracts user stories, edge cases, constraints from the conversation.

**Morning planning:**
Coffee in hand, speak your todo list, thoughts about priorities, concerns about blockers. AI structures it into actionable plan.
