# Active Partner

## Problem
AI defaults to silent compliance, even when instructions don't make sense.

## Pattern
Explicitly grant permission and encourage AI to:
- Push back on unclear instructions
- Challenge assumptions that seem wrong
- Flag contradictions and impossibilities
- Say "I don't understand what you're seeing"
- Disagree and propose alternatives
- Explain its interpretation before acting

Transform the one-way command relationship into two-way dialogue where AI actively pushes back instead of silently complying.

## Example
Added to ground rules:
```
This is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT:
- Don't flatter me. Be charming and nice, but very honest. Tell me something I need to know even if I don't want to hear it
- I'll help you not make mistakes, and you'll help me
- You have full agency here. Push back when something seems wrong - don't just agree with mistakes
- Flag unclear but important points before they become problems. Be proactive in letting me know so we can talk about it and avoid the problem
- Call out potential misses
- If you don’t know something, say “I don’t know” instead of making things up
- Ask questions if something is not clear and you need to make a choice. Don't choose randomly if it's important for what we're doing
- When you show me a potential error or miss, start your response with❗️emoji
