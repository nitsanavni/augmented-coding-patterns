## Problem
Context bloat â†’ AI loses focus, effectiveness degrades
Too much always-loaded information drowns out what matters for the current task

## Pattern
On-demand knowledge documents
- Either you ask AI to pull them or AI searches and pulls when needed
- Not always loaded
- Granular control over what's in context

## Example
`bash.md` - load only when writing bash scripts
`tdd.process.md` - load only when doing TDD
`project.md` - load only when need architecture context

Keep context small, maintain focus.
