# Take All Paths

## Problem
Prototyping used to be expensive, so we'd only try one or two approaches.
We'd pick the "most likely" solution and hope it worked. Better alternatives stayed unexplored.

## Pattern
Prototyping is now so cheap that you can try all paths. Build 10 variations, not 1. Test them all. Pick the best.
Learn as you're prototyping. With AI, a working prototype costs almost nothing. You can build and test multiple prototypes per day.
Actually feel how each one works instead of imagining it.

## Example
**Claude Code's todo list**: 20 prototypes in 2 days
- Inline progress vs drawer vs pill vs spinner
- Each variation fully functional, tested with users
- Found the best through exploration, not guesswork

**UX decisions**: Instead of mockups, build 10 working versions. Play with all of them (can also borrow behaviors and combine)

The power: You're no longer limited to your first idea. Explore the whole solution space.
