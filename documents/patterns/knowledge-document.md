# Knowledge Document

## Problem
AI cannot learn from you
- Stateless (no memory between sessions)
- Fixed model weights (cannot be trained)

_(See [[../obstacles/cannot-learn.md]] for details)_

## Pattern
Use markdown files as AI's persistent memory

## Example
`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` - AI behavior rules
`project.md` - project context
