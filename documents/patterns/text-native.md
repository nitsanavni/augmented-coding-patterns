# Text Native

## Problem
We underuse text as a thinking and planning medium. We reach for specialized tools, databases, UIs when text would be more powerful and accessible.

Text is everything now. Staying in text keeps everything at your fingertips - no barriers, instant editing, AI's strongest modality.

## Pattern
Stay in text. Use ASCII as lightweight diagrams - like markdown is to code, ASCII is to images.

**Text is AI's native medium** - it thinks in text, responds in text. When you stay in text:
- No tool switching, no format conversion
- Instant iteration
- Both human and AI can edit directly
- Creates a shared whiteboard you can draw on together

## Example

**Hack4Good UI Redesign:**
Speech therapy app needed UI changes. Instead of building immediately:

1. **Paper sketches** - Designer drew new modal design
2. **AI converts to ASCII** - Showed sketches to AI, got ASCII mockup
3. **Human edits ASCII** - Changed button text, refined layout in text
4. **ASCII to markdown spec** - Documented the design decisions
5. **Spec to todo list** - Clear implementation steps
6. **Todos to code** - Each step verifiable


**Architecture diagrams:**
```
User → Load Balancer → [Server Pool] → Database
           ↓                ↓
        Cache Layer    Message Queue
```

**Understanding new codebases:**
"Explain architecture for this code base on a high level. Use ASCII if it's helpful"
