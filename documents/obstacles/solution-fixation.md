# Solution Fixation (Obstacle)

## Description
AI latches onto the first plausible solution and loses critical thinking.
When it finds something that *might* be the problem, it declares "found it!" and stops exploring alternatives.

## Impact
- Jumps to conclusions without validating root cause
- Treats hypotheses as facts
- Misses the actual problem while fixating on red herrings
- Declares victory prematurely: "This must be it!"
- Stops being critical or rational once a pattern matches
