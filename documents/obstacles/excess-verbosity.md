# Excess Verbosity (Obstacle)

## Description
AI is a token machine - verbose by default, often overwhelming you with unnecessary detail, filler, and redundancy.

The level of detail you get by default when talking to it rarely matches your actual level of curiosity.

## Impact
- Overwhelming - hard to scan responses and find what matters 
- Low signal-to-noise ratio makes everything harder to maintain and trust
- Makes it hard for a human to follow and makes a human likely to tune out
- Knowledge documents accumulate bloat over time (document rot)
