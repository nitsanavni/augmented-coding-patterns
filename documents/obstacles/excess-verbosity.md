# Excess Verbosity (Obstacle)

## Description
AI is verbose by default, often padding responses with filler, redundancy, or going into an unnecessary level of detail.

## Impact
- Lowers signal-to-noise ratio.
- Overwhelms users with extraneous information.
- Causes knowledge documents to accumulate bloat (“document rot”), making them harder to scan, maintain, and trust.
