# Context Rot (Obstacle)

## Description
Context degrades as conversation grows over time. Earlier instructions lose influence. Signal gets buried under noise and repetition.

## Impact
LLM stops following earlier instructions. Happens long before hitting context window limit.

Performance decays through three zones:
- **Focus zone**: Everything followed reliably
- **Effective context**: Decent but degrading
- **Context window**: Unreliable, rotting
